# 🚗 IoT Smart Car Parking System

A C++ simulation of a smart parking system that manages car entries, exits, and live parking slot status using simple logic and terminal interaction.

---

## 💡 Project Overview

This project mimics a basic IoT-based smart car parking system using C++. It simulates parking slots and allows a user to park or remove cars, check slot status, and handle full or invalid entries. It’s a beginner-friendly implementation meant to demonstrate the core concept of intelligent parking automation.
